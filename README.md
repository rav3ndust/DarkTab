# DarkTab by rav3ndust
A simple, custom New Tab page I made for myself to use on my browsers. You're free to use it, too! I'll be updating it quite a bit.
It features a simple red-on-black layout, displays the current date and time as delegated by your browser, and has a quote of the day that scrolls across the screen.
On the bottom of the screen are links to a few freedom-respecting websites.

I don't suspect many people besides myself will be interested in using this since it is just a minimal New Tab page. I am simply hosting it on my GitHub so I can quickly *git clone* it for usage on fresh installs of GNU/Linux distributions. 
If you like it and want to use it for yourself, feel free! Customize the markup and make it your own! If you make something cool with it, consider contributing your changes back to DarkTab so I can merge it!
